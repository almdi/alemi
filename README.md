Hey there, this is looking pretty rough and took me much longer to set up than I'd like to admit but oh well, small steps.

This will be my own personal homepage that hopefully I will keep updating over time and not let it go to waste like the many attempts before, he.

Anyway, the gist of this is that I will be creating a "homepage" if you want to call it that for myself which I can then update over time and make it look better and whatnot. Also trying to use it as a playground for my ideas and see if I can do certain things. So cheers to that, I guess.

# Things I shouldn't forget for next time

- ssh keygen
- github tokens
- pacman -S github-cli for easier management of my credentials
- SPC p a in emacs and then look for the dir that I want to add as a project
- SPC p p in emacs to open the project that I want
